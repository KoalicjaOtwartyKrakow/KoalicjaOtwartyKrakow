## Summary

## Use of IETF Keywords

This document employs a subset of the Internet Engineering Task Force keywords found in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119). These words are MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY and their counterparts MUST NOT, SHOULD NOT, MAY NOT. They are capitalized throughout the document to draw attention to their special status as keywords used to indicate requirements levels.

Readers are directed to interpret them as requirements at levels consistent with their term of art definitions in the IETF [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
